# Prostate Cancer Outcome Prediction

This R project involves building and evaluating multiple regression models to predict prostate cancer outcomes. Various regression techniques, including Multiple Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression, are implemented and evaluated.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the URL "http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/prostate.data." It contains data related to prostate cancer and serves as the basis for training and testing the regression models.

## Packages Used

This project relies on the following packages and libraries:

1. **Base R**: Utilized for general data manipulation and scripting.

2. **Matrix**: Loaded with `library(Matrix)` for matrix-related operations, particularly in Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

3. **Other built-in R functions**: Various built-in R functions are used for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Please note that the code provided primarily relies on the base R functionality, with the `Matrix` package being used specifically for matrix operations in the PCA section.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.
